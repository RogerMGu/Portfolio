The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies/
I downloaded it at 02-06-2022.

The aim of this project is to practice my SQL and Tableau skills.

There are two data files inside the netflixdata_may2022 folder:
- credits.xlsx: contains information about the actors and directors of the titles.
- titles.xlsx: contains information about the titles (name, type, release year, imdb score, imdb votes, genres...)

Firstly, I did some SQL queries to explore the dataset and find the most interesting combination of variables to later showcase in the dashboard.
The SQL file can be found in these folder as Netflix Titles.sql.

Then, I created a dashboard with Tableau Public, loading the same two files and linking them with the title id.
The dashboard was published at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roger.moncl.s.gum./viz/NetflixTitles_16611964273010/Dashboard1
I have also uploaded a pdf with the dashboard (not interactive) and the tableau project file.

I had previously created a similar dashboard in Tableau for Disney+ shows and movies:
