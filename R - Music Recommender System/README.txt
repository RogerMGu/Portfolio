Data downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs

tracks_features.csv contains the original data from kaggle obtained in 18/11/2024. Move it to the same folder as the scripts and execute them in order from 1 to 3.

You may need to install some packages.

Next, I will explain what each script accomplishes:

1. Music Data Preparation.R: this script is needed to:
  - Select only the relevant columns.
  - Set the correct typing of each column.
  - Fix errors.
  - Normalize numeric data.
  - Change some texting format.
  The output of the script is the file tracks_prepared.csv, which will be used in the next script.
