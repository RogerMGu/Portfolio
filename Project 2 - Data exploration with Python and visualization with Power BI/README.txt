This project involved developing an exploratory analysis of the Sales of a Pizza restaurant during 2015.

The main goal of the project was to provide insights into the restaurant's operations and identify potential areas of improvement.

To do so, I have created three files:

- A python notebook file for the initial exploration looking for insights.

- A Power BI project with a dashboard to visualize the insights found.

- There is also a .pdf file containing the dashboard, in case there is a problem with the Power BI project.
